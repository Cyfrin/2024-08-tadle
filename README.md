## About the Project


Tadle is a cutting-edge pre-market infrastructure designed to unlock illiquid assets in the crypto pre-market.

Our first product, the Points Marketplace, empowers projects to unlock the liquidity and value of points systems before conducting the Token Generation Event (TGE). By facilitating seamless trading and providing a secure, trustless environment, Tadle ensures that your community can engage with your tokens and points dynamically and efficiently.
